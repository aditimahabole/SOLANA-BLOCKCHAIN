WALLET
In Solana, a wallet is a software program or an application that is used to store and manage a user's public and private keys.
The wallet allows users to access their Solana accounts, sign transactions, and interact with the Solana blockchain.
TOKEN ACCOUNT
A token account is a type of Solana account that is used to hold and manage tokens.
Token accounts can be created using a Solana wallet or a programmatic method.
These accounts are similar to regular Solana accounts, but they are designed specifically for managing tokens.
MINT ACCOUNT
A mint account is a special type of account that is used to create new tokens.
When a new token is created, it is assigned a unique mint account that is responsible for managing the supply and distribution of the token.
PDA
A PDA, or Program Derived Address, is a type of Solana account that is created programmatically.
PDAs are used in Solana smart contracts to represent entities such as token accounts, mint accounts, or metadata accounts.
PDAs are derived from a program and a set of parameters, and their state is controlled by the program.
METADATA ACCOUNT
A metadata account is a type of Solana account that is used to store metadata associated with a particular NFT or other digital asset.
Metadata accounts can contain information such as the name, description, and image associated with the asset,
as well as other data such as the creator's name and contact information.
These accounts are managed by the owner of the NFT or asset and can be accessed and updated using a Solana wallet or programmatic method
